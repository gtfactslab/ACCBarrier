# ACCBarrier

The files in this repository are used to produce the case studies of our paper titled “Interval-valued markov chain abstraction of stochastic systems using barrier functions”.

Running the files require Python 2.7, MATLAB and all files found in this repository, as well as the packages "cvx", "SDPT3-4.0" and "SOSTOOLS.303" which have to be located in the folder where these files are saved.

In order to generate the verification case study, run the "Barrier_Verification.py" file. In order to generate the synthesis case study, run the "Barrier_Synthesis.py" file. Note that we maximized the probability of the complement of specification phi to synthesize a policy minimizing the probability of phi.

The files "pqfile.mat" and pqfile_under.mat" contain under and over approximations of the unit square centered at the origin, which are used to approximate any state in the partition as detailed in the paper.

These files are unparallelized versions of the abstraction procedure. In order to speed up the runtime, feel free to parallelize the loops in the function "Probability_Interval_Computation_Barrier" in the file "Barrier_Verification_Functions.py", and the loops in the function "BMDP_Probability_Interval_Computation_Barrier" in the file "Barrier_Synthesis_Functions.py".
